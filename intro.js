/*
  - ES2015 finalized in June, 2015. One JavaScript, no versioning needed for engines, everything is backwards compatible (don't break the web)
  - ECMA 2015: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/
  - Transpilers: ES6 -> ES5: Babel and Traceur but more and more browsers are implementing natively.
  - Table: http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/
  - ES6 supper set, everything is backwards compatible
  - New features live side by side the older features:
    var vs let: let is superior version of var for example 'Let' does not replace 'var'
  - Three main categories of changes:
    Better syntax for features that already exist, or provided through libraries:
      Classes
      Modules
      etc
    New functionality in the standard library. For example:
      New methods for strings and Arrays
      Promises
      Maps, Sets
      etc
    Completely new features. For example:
      Generators
      Proxies
      WeakMaps
      etc
